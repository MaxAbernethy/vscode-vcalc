- neg operation
- needs trigonometry, deg rad conversion
- vec3, and perhaps an option to convert in place / clean up
- truncate to some readable number of significant digits
- replace would be nice
- maybe a little bit stricter pattern matching, like I don't need the 3 in vec3 highlighted there.  make it start with a non-alnum character and just chuck that character.
